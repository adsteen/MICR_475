# introduction: Within the mpg dataset, I wanted to investigate the relationship between manufacturers and highway mileage within the different classes of vehicles.
```{r data}
library(tidyverse)
data(mpg)
print(mpg)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy, colour = class))


```
This plot suggests that classes of vehicle seem to be the determinant of highway mileage, rather than the manufacturers of those cars. So to put in simpler terms; rather than buying a car based on the manufacturer, put more consideration into the vehicle class and your lifestyle.
